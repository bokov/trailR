Description: A small set of utilities that can wrap most things that can enter 
    (via tread() and tload()) or leave (via tsave()) your script and log them 
    with hashes and timestamps. Instead of the overhead and complexity of 
    logging everything your scripts do, this packages assumes you are already 
    using version control on your scripts so the only thing that needs to be 
    logged is which data files are being read by which version of your script. 
    If you have an exact match on your data and your script it should be 
    possible to reproduce any results you got at an earlier point in time. 
    Random numbers can be an issue and that is what the tseed() function is for.
    None of this works for interactive sessions, because by definition 
    interactive sessions are not reproducible research. The role of an 
    interactive session is to design and test your data analysis process, which 
    you then save as a script and publish only the output from that script.
